  TextForTut: This Newly Awakened Power allows the user to manipulate The time flow
    of Objects around you while keeping yourself seperate From the Timeline. Once
    you either run out of energy or decide to manually stop the Device  the Timelines
    will merge back together and you will be "In the Past". Maybe that platform could
    be used to release the locked door from the overide switch.
